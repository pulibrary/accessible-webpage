                <p>
                    The K-pop group AESPA's storyline is based on the
                    idea that people exist in both the real world and
                    a virtual world, where their data is used to create
                    digital avatars. These avatars, called æs, are said
                    to be a more perfect version of a person,
                    representing who they choose to show to the world.
                    The group's name, AESPA, combines the initials for
                    "avatar" and "experience" with the word "aspect",
                    which means "two sides".

                    <blockquote>
                        "In the music video for "Black Mamba", Aespa's
                        members are seen in a futuristic, surreal reality
                        and meet an enormous black snake. Fantastical,
                        neon-lit scenes of intense, floor-dropping
                        choreography are interspersed with moments
                        that highlight each member exploring this new
                        reality and engaging with the æ-members, and
                        hinting to a villain known as the titular black
                        mamba. Each member connects with her alter ego
                        through a mysterious mobile app called Synk.
                        By the end, a distorted human figure emerges
                        with glitching digital pixels."

                        the antagonist that's threatening and
                        interfering with "Synk" which is the connection
                        between themselves and the "ae".

                        rough-textured and a strong wobble bass. The
                        lyrics talk about the avatars and aespa
                        fighting in a battle with Black Mamba. A new

                        displaying their superpowers throughout
                        the city. It features each member possessing
                        an 'otherworldly power' - Karina's super
                        strength, Ningning's control over fire,
                        Winter's floating in the air and Giselle's
                        time-looping. The visual starts with Karina
                        surviving a fall from way high up onto a car.
                        Moments later, she leaves the shattered vehicle
                        unharmed... Additionally, AI
                        technology was used to move still photos
                        of Aespa's faces in synergy with the lyrics
                        of the song."
